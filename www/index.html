					<h2>The Hexahedron Game Engine</h2>
					<p> 
						Hexahedron is a <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a> 
						game engine based on the <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.com/">jMonkeyEngine</a> 
						graphics engine.
						<br />
						In hexahedron, the world consists of only cubes (hexahedra).
						This allows for complete implementations of everything required 
						for a game (lighting, physics, AI, level editing etc.), with much less
						code and effort both within the engine and in games using it. The cube
						system may be simple, but it still gives full scope for complex level designs
						in a variety of game types.

					<h2>Current Status</h2>
					<p>
						Hexahedron is currently in early development, so to try it you will need to get
						the code from SVN on the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hexahedron/">project page</a>, but already some key features
						are implemented:
						<ul>
							<li>
								Static world made of cubes. Uses an 
								<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octree</a> for efficient drawing
							</li>
							<li>
								Perfectly accurate dynamic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_occlusion">ambient occlusion lighting</a> of cubes
							</li>
							<li>
								Perfectly accurate dynamic directional (sun) lighting of cubes
							</li>
							<li>
								Swept <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_detection">collision detection</a> between moving
								cuboids (e.g. players, objects) and the world. This is both integer accurate (allowing for perfect sliding "logic" in 
								puzzle games) and fast. Since the detection is swept, it is impossible for objects to move "through" the world, even
								when moving at high speed.
							</li>
							<li>
								Basic "FPS" physics, allowing for moving cuboids (e.g. players) to slide 
								along walls, fall, jump etc. This will be extended to more complex physics 
								like friction, bouncing, etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						There is a simple demonstration of these features in the form of an FPS-style game where the player can walk and jump
						through a level.
					</p>
					<br/>
		
					<h2>Development</h2>
					<p>
						Development is currently concentrating on making a playable game, where the player must run and jump through
						a series of obstacles. This is designed to test and demonstrate the engine, but should hopefully also be an
						enjoyable game in itself. Additional features required to implement this system include:
						<ul>
							<li>
						 		Improved player handling such as crouching, better jumping control, and perhaps jumping to ledges, etc.
							</li>
							<li>
								Collision detection between moving objects - for example obstacles like spikes and blades colliding with the player.
							</li>
							<li>
								Simple entity/property system for player and obstacle properties like health, damage amounts, etc.
							</li>
							<li>
								Annotation system to give properties to cubes and cube faces, for example to make bouncy faces, points that can be grabbed onto, etc.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
